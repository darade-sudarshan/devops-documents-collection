## Which container registry do you use in your organization?

### Question  
Which container registry does your organization use for storing and managing container images?

### Short explanation of the question  
This is a straightforward question that helps interviewers understand your familiarity with secure image storage, image scanning, versioning, and how container registries are integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

### Answer  
We primarily use **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** in our organization. It integrates well with AWS services, supports image scanning, and works smoothly with our CI/CD pipelines. We also occasionally use **Docker Hub** for public images and **GitHub Container Registry** for internal projects hosted on GitHub.

### Detailed explanation of the answer for readers’ understanding

In most production environments, using a secure, scalable, and integrated container registry is critical. Here’s a breakdown of commonly used registries and why Amazon ECR is a strong choice:

---

### 🐳 **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**

- **Fully managed** Docker container registry by AWS
- Integrated with **IAM for fine-grained permissions**
- Supports **private and public** repositories
- Easily integrates with **ECS, EKS, and CodePipeline**
- Built-in **image vulnerability scanning** using Amazon Inspector
- **Versioned** image tagging and support for lifecycle policies to clean up old images

**Example** workflow:

- Build Docker image in GitHub Actions
- Authenticate with AWS ECR using `aws ecr get-login-password`
- Push the image using `docker push`

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
docker build -t myapp .
docker tag myapp:latest <repo-url>:latest
docker push <repo-url>:latest
```

### 🐙 **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**

- Great for projects already hosted on GitHub
- Uses GitHub token for authentication
- Easy to integrate with GitHub Actions

---

### 🧰 Other Common Registries

- **Docker Hub** – widely used for public images
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** – ideal for Azure-based projects
- **Google Container Registry / Artifact Registry** – for GCP users
- **Harbor** – for on-prem self-hosted enterprise registries

### 🧠 Real-world Insight

> “We had a security policy to scan every image before deployment. ECR’s native scanning and IAM-based access control made it easy to enforce. We also set up lifecycle rules to delete untagged images older than 14 days, saving storage costs.”

### Key takeaway

> "Choosing the right container registry depends on your cloud provider, CI/CD integration needs, and security policies. ECR works best for AWS-centric workflows."
